# What Are the Qiraat?
The Qiraat refer to the various accepted methods of Quranic recitation, passed down through a continuous chain of transmission (Sanad) from the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ to us today. These recitations showcase different pronunciations, dialects, and linguistic nuances, offering a deeper appreciation of the Quran's richness.

## The 10 Authentic Qiraat
There are 10 authentic Qiraat recognized in the Islamic tradition, each named after a famous reciter. These reciters and their students played a crucial role in preserving the recitations, and their names are synonymous with these distinct methods. The 10 Qiraat are:

- **Nafiʽ al-Madani**: Transmitted by Qaloon and Warsh.
- **Ibn Kathir al-Makki**: Transmitted by Al-Bazzi and Qunbul.
- **Abu Amr al-Basri**: Transmitted by Ad-Duri and As-Susi.
- **Ibn Amir ash-Shami**: Transmitted by Hisham and Ibn Dhakwan.
- **Asim al-Kufi**: Transmitted by Hafs and Shu'bah.
- **Hamzah al-Kufi**: Transmitted by Khalaf and Khallad.
- **Al-Kisai al-Kufi**: Transmitted by Abul Harith and Ad-Duri.

- **Yaqub al-Hadrami**: Transmitted by Ruways and Rawh.
- **Khalaf al-Bazzar**: Transmitted by Ishaq and Idris.

## Why Are There Different Qiraat?
The variation in Qiraat exists due to the flexibility provided by Allah to accommodate the diverse linguistic backgrounds of early Muslims. The Quran was revealed in different dialects to make it easy for the various tribes to recite and memorize. These Qiraat are not contradictory but complementary, and each recitation maintains the integrity and message of the Quran.

## Learning the Qiraat
To learn the Qiraat, students traditionally study under a certified teacher who holds an Ijazah (license) in a particular Qiraat. This ensures that the method is preserved and passed on authentically. By studying the Qiraat, students gain a deeper understanding of the Quran's linguistic richness and the wisdom in its diversity.

# The Ijazah Tradition in Quranic Recitation

The Ijazah tradition is one of the most revered practices in Islamic scholarship, particularly in the field of Quranic recitation. Ijazah, in Arabic, means "authorization" or "license." In the context of Quranic studies, it refers to the certificate granted by a qualified teacher that authorizes a student to teach and recite the Quran as per the traditional rules and methods.

## What Is an Ijazah?

In the study of Quranic recitation, an Ijazah serves as both a certification of proficiency and a chain of transmission (Sanad) linking the recipient back to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This Sanad is crucial, as it ensures that the Quran has been passed down correctly, preserving its authenticity and accuracy. A student who earns an Ijazah can trace their learning lineage through their teacher and all the previous scholars back to the Prophet himself, ensuring an unbroken chain of oral transmission.

## The Process of Earning an Ijazah

To receive an Ijazah, a student must study under a qualified teacher, often over several years, mastering both the theoretical and practical aspects of Quranic recitation. The student must demonstrate a thorough understanding of Tajweed (the rules of Quranic pronunciation), the specific Qiraat (recitation styles), and often the memorization of the entire Quran (Hifz).

The final step involves the student reciting the Quran or specific portions of it in front of their teacher, who assesses their accuracy and mastery. Upon successful completion, the student is granted an Ijazah, giving them the authority to teach and recite the Quran in that specific tradition.

## The Importance of Ijazah in Quranic Tradition

The Ijazah system ensures the integrity of Quranic recitation across generations. This tradition preserves the proper pronunciation, melody, and rhythm of the Quran, as it was revealed. It also reflects the seriousness with which the Muslim Ummah (community) has safeguarded the Quran from any errors or distortions over time.

## Benefits of Earning an Ijazah

By earning an Ijazah, a student not only gains the right to teach others but also strengthens their connection to a centuries-old tradition of scholarship. The honor of being part of this Sanad links them directly to the Prophet ﷺ through their teacher. Additionally, it serves as a testament to their mastery of the recitation style and their commitment to preserving the Quran.

## Did You Know?

Many scholars and teachers who grant Ijazah today have learned through a system of Talaqqi (oral instruction) and Mushafahah (face-to-face recitation), which has been passed down for over 1,400 years. The tradition of Ijazah is still thriving in many parts of the world, including institutions like Al-Azhar in Egypt, where hundreds of students earn Ijazah each year.

For those interested in earning an Ijazah and continuing this noble tradition, visit QiraatHub to learn how you can begin your journey of Quranic recitation with authentic Sanad.

# Learning the Quran for Non-Arabic Speakers: Challenges, Solutions, and Opportunities

Islam transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries. While the Quran was revealed in Arabic, millions of Muslims worldwide, irrespective of their native language, strive to learn and recite the Quran in Arabic as part of their religious obligations. However, for non-Arabic speakers, reciting the Quran can pose certain challenges, from mastering pronunciation to understanding the meaning behind the verses. In this article, we’ll explore the difficulties faced by non-Arabic speakers in learning the Quran, how modern technology can aid their journey, and where to find the best Quranic learning platforms to enhance their recitation and comprehension.

## Challenges for Non-Arabic Speakers

One of the main challenges for non-Arabic speakers is the complexity of Arabic phonetics. The Quranic style is both rhythmic and precise, and mastering the correct pronunciation of letters and sounds is essential to preserving the meaning. Additionally, learning Tajweed—the rules governing the pronunciation during Quranic recitation—requires time and consistent practice. Non-Arabic speakers also struggle with understanding the deeper meanings of the Quran since they may not be familiar with the language’s grammar, syntax, and nuances.

## Technology as a Game-Changer

Thankfully, modern technology has made Quranic learning more accessible for non-Arabic speakers. Mobile apps, online classes, and interactive platforms now offer guided lessons on recitation, pronunciation, and understanding the meaning of the Quran. With features like voice recognition, learners can practice reciting verses and receive immediate feedback on their pronunciation. Virtual classes with native Arabic-speaking teachers allow learners to receive personalized attention and overcome their specific challenges.

## Finding the Best Quran Classes for Non-Arabic Speakers

If you’re looking to master Quranic recitation, several institutions and platforms offer specialized courses for non-Arabic speakers. These classes often focus on teaching both the pronunciation (Tajweed) and the meaning behind the verses, ensuring learners not only recite the Quran correctly but also understand it. A prime example is QiraatHub, where expert teachers guide students through the fundamentals of Quranic recitation, Tajweed, and the ten Qiraat styles, offering personalized feedback and Ijazah upon successful completion.

By leveraging both traditional teaching methods and modern technological tools, you can enhance your Quran learning experience and fulfill your religious duties to the fullest.

![images of Quran and tasweeh](/images/quran_and_tasweeh.jpg)

## How Long Does It Take to Read the Quran?

The time it takes to read the Quran varies significantly from person to person. On average, a complete reading of the Quran typically requires 30–40 hours. Here's a breakdown of common scenarios:

- **Beginners**: For those just learning to recite Arabic, reading may be slower due to focusing on pronunciation and Tajweed rules.
- **Fluent Readers**: Proficient reciters can complete the Quran in 15–25 hours, spread across several days or weeks.
- **Advanced Readers**: With expertise in recitation, the Quran can be read in as little as 10–12 hours, though this is less common and requires intense focus.

However, it is prohibited to finish reading the Quran before three days. In a hadith narrated by Abdullah Ibn Amr (RA:), he said, "Prophet Muhammad (SAW)ﷺ said, Do not finish reading Quran before 3 days."

*Sunan al-Tirmidhi*

So, it is crucial to read the Quran with Tarteel, which means reading the Quran with patience, in proper order, and with no haste.

## How Long Does it Take to Read the Quran for the Beginner?

The time it may take to read the Quran as a total beginner varies from condition to condition, considering many variables like the ability to read, knowledge of Arabic, the commitment of time, and the manner of approaching it. 

Here are some general guidelines to estimate:

### Familiarity with Arabic:
- **Complete beginner in Arabic**: If you are learning to read the Arabic script from scratch, it might take a few weeks or months to master it fluently.
- **Basic Arabic reading skills**: If you can already read Arabic but at a slow pace, it might take you longer to get through the Quran.

### Reading Speed
- The Quran contains approximately 77,430 words and is divided into 30 sections called Juz.
- It takes 10-20 minutes for beginners to read one page slowly and carefully.
- With 604 pages in the Quran, reading just 1 page daily would take about two years to complete.
- Reading 1 Juz per day would take 30 days to complete; however, this is quite a difficult pace for beginners.

### Consistency and Practice
- Beginners often aim to complete the Quran in 6 months to 1 year, reading at a manageable pace, such as 2-3 pages daily.
- Regular practice improves fluency, increasing reading speed and understanding over time.

### Understanding vs. Reading
This will be longer when you aim to read and understand, especially with translation or Tafsir. You can focus on smaller portions daily.

### Tips for Beginners:
1. Set a schedule: Start with a few minutes daily and gradually increase.
2. Learn Tajweed: Understanding Quranic rules of pronunciation will make the reading easier.
3. Use Aids: Transliteration or beginner-friendly Quran copies can aid you in this.

## How Long Does it Take to Read the Quran for a Hafiz?

In the case of a Hafiz, the duration depends on the Hafiz's fluency and speed, and his pattern of recitation. Herein is an overview:

![A group of people reading the Quran](/images/a_group_of_people_are_reading_the_Quran.png)

### 1. Clear Recitation with Tajweed
- One who has memorized the Holy Quran can recite all of it in approximately 10 to 15 hours with average speeds and the proper application of tajweed rules.
- For one reciting one Juz each day, it's easy to complete the Quran within 30 days.

### 2. Quick Recitation
- Some Hafiz can quickly do it while still being very accurate, finishing the Quran in 6 to 8 hours. This is common for one who is experienced in revising (Muraja'ah).

### 3. Reciting Slowly with Reflection
- If the Hafiz does it slowly with a deep focus on meaning and tajweed, then it may take up to 20-25 hours to complete the Quran.

### 4. In Salah
- An experienced Hafiz may take up to 60-90 minutes per Juz during Taraweeh prayers in Ramadan, completing the Quran in, correspondingly, over 20 or 30 nights. 

**Tips for the Hafiz**: Your regular Muraja'ah means fluency and minimum hesitation of your recitation. The speed is up to the balance between speed and proper recitation quality.

## How to Finish Reading the Quran Quickly for Everyone?

Finishing the Quran quickly requires dedication, consistent effort, and an organized approach. Here are tips and strategies for everyone—whether beginner, intermediate, or advanced:

### Break It Down by Daily Goals

### Focus on Fluency
- If you need to improve your reading, prioritize practice to improve speed.
- Beginners may benefit from audio guides or transliterations to aid fluency.

### Avoid Distractions
- Choose a quiet place and set a focused environment.
- Use a timer to track how long it takes to complete a portion, encouraging consistent progress.

### Pair Reading with Listening

### Use Shorter Recitations
- If speed is the goal, use a Mus'haf (Quran copy) with [Uthmani script](https://www.majesticquran.co.uk/difference-between-indopak-and-uthmani-scripts/) or more extensive text, which makes reading easier and faster.

### Make Dua and Stay Motivated
- Pray for Barakah (blessing) in time: Start intending to complete for Allah's sake.
- Reflect on the reward: Every letter read is a good deed multiplied by ten.

### Example Plan: 10-Day Completion
- 6 Juz per day.
- Allocate 1.5–2 hours for reading in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
- Read steadily and avoid over-exertion to maintain consistency.

> **Pro Tip**: If finishing quickly feels overwhelming, focus on quality over speed. Completing the Quran thoughtfully brings more significant spiritual benefits than rushing through it.

## What Happens When You Read the Quran in Ramadan?

Reading the Quran during Ramadan, the holiest month in Islam, holds immense spiritual and emotional significance. Here's what happens when you engage with the Quran during this sacred time:

1. Increased Rewards
2. Spiritual Upliftment
3. Strengthened Connection to Allah
4. Amplified Reflection and Understanding
5. Bonding Through Communal Worship
6. Forgiveness and Mercy
7. Emotional and Psychological Benefits
8. Building Good Habits

## Can You Read the Quran in a Day?

Reading the entire Quran in one day is a monumental task. It's physically doable, but it requires about 12–15 hours of continuous reading, depending on the speed at which one reads.

However, many scholars recommend not rushing the reading of the Quran because it should be a matter of reflection and understanding.

Instead, breaking this into manageable sessions enhances comprehension and spiritual benefit.

No scholars suggest finishing reading the Quran in a single day. Because when you try to finish reading the Quran in a day, it will need high-speed reading. This will often need to be corrected in pronunciation and grammar.

Also, it is prohibited to finish reading the Quran before 3 days.

## How Fast Can You Read the Quran?

![The Quran on the table](/images/the_quran_on_the_table.png)

Speed reading in the Quran recitation depends on several factors. They are given below:

1. **Arabic Proficiency**: Fluency in the language naturally increases speed. It helps you to read the Quran fluently. However, it is not mandatory to be proficient in Arabic. The Quran is the only holy and easy learning book in the world. You don't need to be an Arabic literature, language, or grammar expert. People from any region, country, and culture can read it fluently. But, if you want to narrate the Quran like a Tafseer, you must learn more Arabic things.

[Learn Teaching Quran for Non-Arabic Speakers](/blog/teaching-quran-for-non-arabic-speakers)

2. **Tajweed Mastery**: Proper adherence to recitation rules can slow down reading but enhances spiritual quality. This is why you need to learn tajweed correctly.

3. **Purpose**: Reading for memorization or reflection often takes longer than reading for completion. Normally, little boys or girls have more memorization power to Hifdh the Quran. This is why parents send their children to memorize the Quran at a very young age.

However, if you want only to read the Quran, any person can learn it at any age if he is physically healthy.

## How Can I Read the Quran in 30 Days?

Reading the Quran over 30 days is a popular goal during Ramadan or for personal milestones. Allah (SWT) increases barakah reading the Quran in the holy Ramadan month by 10 to 70 times.

To achieve this, divide the Quran into 30 equal parts (juz) and read one part daily.

- **Daily Time Commitment**: Allocate 20–30 minutes daily for consistent progress. Target finishes reading the book in 27 days. Read 1.5 chapters (Para) in the first 6 days, then try to finish 1 chapter daily. Thus, you can complete reading the book in 27 days.
- **Create a Routine**: Choose a time that aligns with your schedule, such as after Fajr or before Maghrib.
- **Use a Planner**: Track your progress to stay motivated and on target.

## How Many Pages of the Quran Should I Read Per Day?

The Quran contains 604 pages, depending on the script used. To read it in a month:

- Read 20 pages daily for a 30-day plan.
- Divide this further into 5 pages after each prayer, making it manageable and less overwhelming.
- For slower readers, consider stretching the goal to 40 or 60 days.

## How Quickly Can You Memorise the Quran?

Memorizing the Quran, or becoming a Hafiz, is a cherished accomplishment in Islam. Children have very sharp memories or brains to learn the Quran. Aged people take time to capture the Quran or often forget it. That is why parents who want their children to be Hafij, admit institutions at a very young age.

The timeframe varies widely:

- **Dedicated Learners**: With intensive daily practice, memorization can take 1–3 years.
- **Part-Time Learners**: It may take 5–10 years for those with limited time.

## Tips for Memorization:

1. **Small Portions**: Start with short surahs and gradually increase.
2. **Consistent Revision**: Daily review ensures retention.
3. **Seek Guidance**: A qualified tutor can streamline the process.

## Practical Tips for Reading the Quran

- Set Realistic Goals: Consistency is key to completing it in a week, a month, or longer.
- Focus on Meaning: Accompany reading with a translation to deepen your connection.
- Seek Support: Join Quran circles or hire a tutor for guidance and encouragement.
- Make Du'a: Ask Allah for ease and understanding in your journey with the Quran.

# How to Make Dua in Sujood? A Complete Step-by-Step Guide

![How to Make Dua in Sujood? A Complete Step-by-Step Guide](/images/how-to-make-dua.png)

Sujood, or prostration, is a pivotal part of Muslim prayer, where a worshipper lowers their body to the ground as a symbol of utmost humility and submission to Allah. It is during this sacred moment that a Muslim draws nearest to the Divine, making it the most fitting time to make dua (supplication) — a heartfelt prayer seeking Allah's mercy, guidance, forgiveness, and blessings. 

Many believers ask, **"How to make dua in sujood?"** or wonder about **what to say in sujood**, especially during the special night prayer, **Tahajjud**, or the five daily prayers **(salah)**. 

This article provides an in-depth, step-by-step guide to help you make the most of your dua in sujood, supported by Islamic teachings and practical advice.

## What Is Sujood and Why Is Dua in Sujood Important?

### The Meaning and Significance of Sujood

Sujood, derived from the Arabic root meaning "to bow down," is a fundamental act in the five daily prayers where a Muslim places their forehead and nose firmly on the ground, alongside their hands, knees, and toes. 

This physical posture is the ultimate expression of humility, surrender, and devotion. It signifies the worshipper's acknowledgment of Allah's greatness and their dependence.

### Spiritual Proximity to Allah

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught that when a believer is in sujood, they are at their closest point to Allah. This is more than just a physical closeness; it represents a spiritual intimacy where the servant's heart is open and vulnerable before the Creator. The hadith states:

> "The servant is closest to his Lord when he is prostrating, so increase your supplications therein." (Sahih Muslim)

This highlights the importance of using this moment to sincerely make dua, knowing it is the time when Allah is most attentive to your pleas.

### Dua as a Form of Worship

Dua in sujood is not merely asking for worldly needs; it is a worship act that deepens your connection with Allah. It is a time to express gratitude, admit shortcomings, ask for forgiveness, and request guidance. Raising your hands and heart to Allah in sujood reflects the humility and sincerity that dua requires.

## What to Say in Sujood?

### The Traditional Tasbih

During sujood, the Prophet (PBUH) instructed Muslims to say:

> **"Subhana Rabbiyal A'la"**  
> (Glory is to my Lord, the Most High)

Usually recited three times, this glorification reminds the believer of Allah's supreme greatness and purity.

### Personal Supplications

Beyond this prescribed tasbih, sujood is the perfect opportunity to make **personal duas**. You can talk to Allah in your own words or use traditional supplications taught by the Prophet (PBUH). This could be asking for forgiveness, healing, protection, success, or any need close to your heart.

### Language and Sincerity

While Arabic duas are recommended, especially those taught by the Prophet (PBUH), Allah understands every language and every heartfelt expression. The sincerity of your heart matters more than the specific words. Speak to Allah honestly and humbly — this is what truly counts.

## How to Make Dua in Sujood During Salah

### Dua in Obligatory Prayers

Many Muslims wonder if making dua in sujood during the obligatory five daily prayers is appropriate. The answer is yes. While you must recite the necessary parts of salah, such as the tasbih, you can also silently make personal supplications during your sujood.

### Balancing Worship and Dua

Since salah has specific recitations, it's best to make your dua after reciting "Subhana Rabbiyal A'la." This ensures you fulfill the formal requirements of prayer while also engaging in heartfelt conversation with Allah.

### Using Sujood in Sunnah and Nafl Prayers

In non-obligatory prayers like Sunnah or Nafl, you have more freedom to make longer, personal duas during sujood. Take advantage of these times to deepen your connection and ask for whatever you need.

## How to Make Dua in Sujood Step by Step

To help you get the most out of your dua in sujood, here is a detailed step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Heart and Mind

Before performing sujood, take a moment to clear your mind and focus on your intention (niyyah). Approach this act humbly, understanding that you are standing before the Almighty.

### Step 2: Perform Sujood Correctly

Lower yourself so that your forehead and nose touch the ground alongside your palms, knees, and toes. This full contact with the earth symbolizes submission and reverence.

### Step 3: Recite the Tasbih

Say **"Subhana Rabbiyal A'la"** at least three times. This glorifies Allah and prepares your heart for supplication.

### Step 4: Praise Allah and Send Salawat

Before making your dua, start with praising Allah using phrases like **"Alhamdulillah"** (All praise is for Allah) or **"Ya Allah, You are the Most Merciful."** Also, send blessings on the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) by saying phrases such as **"Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad"** (O Allah, send peace upon Muhammad).

### Step 5: Make Your Personal Dua

Pour your heart out. Ask for forgiveness, mercy, guidance, health, protection, success — whatever you need. You can speak in Arabic or your language. The key is sincerity and focus.

### Step 6: End with Gratitude

Finish your dua by thanking Allah for His mercy and blessings. Gratitude strengthens your relationship with Allah and acknowledges His constant presence in your life.

## How to Make Dua in Sujood in Tahajjud

### The Unique Spiritual Atmosphere of Tahajjud

Tahajjud is a voluntary night prayer performed during the last third of the night. It is considered the most blessed time for dua because the world is quiet, distractions are minimal, and Allah's mercy is abundant.

### Step-by-Step Dua in Tahajjud Sujood

1. Perform your tahajjud prayer with sincerity and calm.
2. In sujood, recite the tasbih and then make lengthy, heartfelt duas.
3. This is the ideal time to ask for deep forgiveness, guidance in life, healing, and fulfillment of heartfelt wishes.
4. The quiet solitude enhances concentration, making your dua even more meaningful.

### Hadith on Tahajjud Dua

The Prophet (PBUH) said:

> "Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains and says: 'Who is calling upon Me that I may answer him? Who is asking me to I may give him? Who is seeking my forgiveness that I may forgive him?" ([Sahih al-Bukhari](https://sunnah.com/bukhari))

This encourages believers to make the most of dua during tahajjud sujood.

## Common Duas to Say in Sujood

Here are some dua examples you can incorporate:

- **Seeking Forgiveness**: "Rabbi ighfir li" — O my Lord, forgive me.
- **Comprehensive Forgiveness**: "Allahumma ighfir li dhanbi, waftah li abwaba rahmatika" — O Allah, forgive my sins and open the gates of Your mercy for me.
- **General Requests**: "Ya Allah, guide me, protect me, and bless me in this life and the next."
- **Sayyidul Istighfar**: The master supplication for seeking forgiveness, which the Prophet (PBUH) recommended reciting daily.

Remember, dua does not need to be long; it must be sincere and from the heart.

## Tips for Making Effective Dua in Sujood

1. **Be Sincere and Humble**: Approach Allah with a humble heart, free from arrogance or distractions.
2. **Be Specific in Your Requests**: Ask for what you need or want. Vague or generic requests can be less powerful than specific, heartfelt prayers.
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Make dua in sujood regularly, especially in your daily prayers and tahajjud.
4. **Include Blessings on the Prophet (PBUH)**: Sending salawat is a means of increasing the acceptance of your dua.
5. **Have Patience and Trust**: Sometimes answers come later or in a different form than expected. Trust in Allah's wisdom.
6. **Use Your Own Language**: Speak to Allah in the language that feels most natural to you. Allah understands all languages.
